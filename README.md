ik nobody cares about my socials so they're at the bottom away from the important stuff

here is some things you need to know
- everything NOT in the WIP folder was ripped directly from the game by me meaning its the highest quality you can get (if you need higher just use an AI upscaler)
- the WIP folder contains images with a solid BG. the reason for this is because some assets arent directly exportable so i had to take a screenshot of them. i will key them 
out in the future but for now, either dont worry about them or key them out yourself.
- if youre looking for an asset in a folder that it should be in, one of the following is true: 1) its in the WIP folder. 2) my dumbass put it in another folder somewhere.
3) i havent ripped it yet

gonna try to actively maintain this ripping project so for now, latest update is V 1.0 on January 21 2023




Update V 2 on March 1 2023

added all the new stuff i could find. as well as album covers and the future salmon gear. as well as a folder specifically for the old splash and sploosh icons (i hate the new ones but i understand why they did it)


i have a mid season update planned for this to add some text related things (like titles and stuff)
